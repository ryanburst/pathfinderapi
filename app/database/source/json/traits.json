    "Description":"You never knew your parents���perhaps they died when you were a child, or maybe you were taken from them and raised elsewhere as a slave. You owe your sanity and your life to a woman named Haleen. She could be your sister or merely a childhood companion, but whatever your relationship to her, she took care of you and protected you. She�۪s always been a part of your life, and although her temper often kept her from making friends or keeping a job, she�۪s always been kind to you. Haleen was instrumental in securing your freedom from slavery or making sure you got a good apprenticeship or job in society���but recently, she�۪d been growing strangely morose and depressed. You and Haleen normally kept no secrets, but whatever was bothering her wasn�۪t something she shared with you. One night, she vanished, leaving you a brief note, begging you to forget her and to get on with your life, but something about the note bothered you���something in the way she phrased her words struck you as forced. You may be convinced she�۪d been kidnapped, forced to leave against her will, or even magically controlled, but you also suspect that she left you to protect you from something���that was ever her way. You�۪re now convinced that it�۪s time for you to step in and protect her, but you had no idea where she may have gone until recently. Several months have passed since she disappeared, and you�۪ve spent those months searching for clues to her location, and you�۪ve finally found a lead���a mysterious note, a strange dream, the result of a back-alley divination, or a report of a sighting of a woman matching Haleen�۪s description has come to you, placing Haleen in the vicinity of an old ghost town named Kelmarane. What she�۪s doing there and how she came to be there makes no sense to you yet, but the lead is the strongest one you�۪ve had. This and Garavel�۪s advertisement for mercenaries to accompany him to the region is all the omen you need. You joined Garavel�۪s group and eagerly await the day you�۪ll be leaving for Kelmarane. Although Haleen chose to become a swashbuckling adventurer, she always encouraged you to seek your own path. The class you chose at 1st level is always a favored class to you, and your dedication to it is such that every time you take a level in the class, you gain +1 hit point and 1 additional skill point over and above what you would normally gain. If multiple PCs take this trait, they should be siblings who were both protected and raised by Haleen.",
